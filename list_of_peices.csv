ACT I. Scene I.
Elsinore. A platform before the Castle.

"
3,ACT I - Scene I,"Enter two Sentinels-[first,] Francisco, [who paces up and down
at his po"
4,ACT I - Scene I,"st; then] Bernardo, [who approaches him].

  Ber. Who's there.?
  Fran. "
5,ACT I - Scene I,"Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.
  Ber. Long live the King!
  "
6,ACT I - Scene I,"Fran. Bernardo?
  Ber. He.
  Fran. You come most carefully upon your hou"
7,ACT I - Scene I,"r.
  Ber. 'Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.
  Fran. Fo"
8,ACT I - Scene I,"r this relief much thanks. 'Tis bitter cold,
    And I am sick at heart."
9,ACT I - Scene I,"
  Ber. Have you had quiet guard?
  Fran. Not a mouse stirring.
  Ber. W"
10,ACT I - Scene I,"ell, good night.
    If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
    The rival"
11,ACT I - Scene I,"s of my watch, bid them make haste.

                    Enter Horatio a"
12,ACT I - Scene I,"nd Marcellus.  

  Fran. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?
 "
13,ACT I - Scene I," Hor. Friends to this ground.
  Mar. And liegemen to the Dane.
  Fran. G"
14,ACT I - Scene I,"ive you good night.
  Mar. O, farewell, honest soldier.
    Who hath rel"
15,ACT I - Scene I,"iev'd you?
  Fran. Bernardo hath my place.
    Give you good night.     "
16,ACT I - Scene I,"                              Exit.
  Mar. Holla, Bernardo!
  Ber. Say-
"
17,ACT I - Scene I,"    What, is Horatio there ?
  Hor. A piece of him.
  Ber. Welcome, Hora"
18,ACT I - Scene I,"tio. Welcome, good Marcellus.
  Mar. What, has this thing appear'd again"
19,ACT I - Scene I," to-night?
  Ber. I have seen nothing.
  Mar. Horatio says 'tis but our "
20,ACT I - Scene I,"fantasy,
    And will not let belief take hold of him
    Touching this "
21,ACT I - Scene I,"dreaded sight, twice seen of us.
    Therefore I have entreated him alon"
22,ACT I - Scene I,"g,  
    With us to watch the minutes of this night,
    That, if again "
23,ACT I - Scene I,"this apparition come,
    He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
  Hor"
24,ACT I - Scene I,". Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
  Ber. Sit down awhile,
    And let us "
25,ACT I - Scene I,"once again assail your ears,
    That are so fortified against our story"
26,ACT I - Scene I,",
    What we two nights have seen.
  Hor. Well, sit we down,
    And le"
27,ACT I - Scene I,"t us hear Bernardo speak of this.
  Ber. Last night of all,
    When yon"
28,ACT I - Scene I,"d same star that's westward from the pole
    Had made his course t' ill"
29,ACT I - Scene I,"ume that part of heaven
    Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
  "
30,ACT I - Scene I,"  The bell then beating one-

                        Enter Ghost.

  Ma"
31,ACT I - Scene I,"r. Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!
  Ber. In the same "
32,ACT I - Scene I,"figure, like the King that's dead.  
  Mar. Thou art a scholar; speak to"
33,ACT I - Scene I," it, Horatio.
  Ber. Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.
  Hor"
34,ACT I - Scene I,". Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.
  Ber. It would be spok"
35,ACT I - Scene I,"e to.
  Mar. Question it, Horatio.
  Hor. What art thou that usurp'st th"
36,ACT I - Scene I,"is time of night
    Together with that fair and warlike form
    In whi"
37,ACT I - Scene I,"ch the majesty of buried Denmark
    Did sometimes march? By heaven I ch"
38,ACT I - Scene I,"arge thee speak!
  Mar. It is offended.
  Ber. See, it stalks away!
  Ho"
39,ACT I - Scene I,"r. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak!
                            "
40,ACT I - Scene I,"                         Exit Ghost.
  Mar. 'Tis gone and will not answe"
41,ACT I - Scene I,"r.
  Ber. How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale.
    Is not this s"
42,ACT I - Scene I,"omething more than fantasy?
    What think you on't?
  Hor. Before my Go"
43,ACT I - Scene I,"d, I might not this believe
    Without the sensible and true avouch
   "
44,ACT I - Scene I," Of mine own eyes.  
  Mar. Is it not like the King?
  Hor. As thou art "
45,ACT I - Scene I,"to thyself.
    Such was the very armour he had on
    When he th' ambit"
46,ACT I - Scene I,"ious Norway combated.
    So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle,
  "
47,ACT I - Scene I,"  He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
    'Tis strange.
  Mar. Thus"
48,ACT I - Scene I," twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
    With martial stalk hath h"
49,ACT I - Scene I,"e gone by our watch.
  Hor. In what particular thought to work I know no"
50,ACT I - Scene I,"t;
    But, in the gross and scope of my opinion,
    This bodes some st"
51,ACT I - Scene I,"range eruption to our state.
  Mar. Good now, sit down, and tell me he t"
52,ACT I - Scene I,"hat knows,
    Why this same strict and most observant watch
    So nigh"
53,ACT I - Scene I,"tly toils the subject of the land,
    And why such daily cast of brazen"
54,ACT I - Scene I," cannon
    And foreign mart for implements of war;
    Why such impress"
55,ACT I - Scene I," of shipwrights, whose sore task
    Does not divide the Sunday from the"
56,ACT I - Scene I," week.
    What might be toward, that this sweaty haste  
    Doth make "
57,ACT I - Scene I,"the night joint-labourer with the day?
    Who is't that can inform me?
"
58,ACT I - Scene I,"  Hor. That can I.
    At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
   "
59,ACT I - Scene I," Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
    Was, as you know, by Forti"
60,ACT I - Scene I,"nbras of Norway,
    Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
    Dar"
61,ACT I - Scene I,"'d to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet
    (For so this side of o"
62,ACT I - Scene I,"ur known world esteem'd him)
    Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a sea"
63,ACT I - Scene I,"l'd compact,
    Well ratified by law and heraldry,
    Did forfeit, wit"
64,ACT I - Scene I,"h his life, all those his lands
    Which he stood seiz'd of, to the con"
65,ACT I - Scene I,"queror;
    Against the which a moiety competent
    Was gaged by our ki"
66,ACT I - Scene I,"ng; which had return'd
    To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
    Had he "
67,ACT I - Scene I,"been vanquisher, as, by the same comart
    And carriage of the article "
68,ACT I - Scene I,"design'd,
    His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
    Of uni"
69,ACT I - Scene I,"mproved mettle hot and full,  
    Hath in the skirts of Norway, here an"
70,ACT I - Scene I,"d there,
    Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
    For food and di"
71,ACT I - Scene I,"et, to some enterprise
    That hath a stomach in't; which is no other,
"
72,ACT I - Scene I,"    As it doth well appear unto our state,
    But to recover of us, by "
73,ACT I - Scene I,"strong hand
    And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
    So by h"
74,ACT I - Scene I,"is father lost; and this, I take it,
    Is the main motive of our prepa"
75,ACT I - Scene I,"rations,
    The source of this our watch, and the chief head
    Of thi"
76,ACT I - Scene I,"s post-haste and romage in the land.
  Ber. I think it be no other but e"
77,ACT I - Scene I,"'en so.
    Well may it sort that this portentous figure
    Comes armed"
78,ACT I - Scene I," through our watch, so like the King
    That was and is the question of"
79,ACT I - Scene I," these wars.
  Hor. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
    In the m"
80,ACT I - Scene I,"ost high and palmy state of Rome,
    A little ere the mightiest Julius "
81,ACT I - Scene I,"fell,
    The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead
    Did sque"
82,ACT I - Scene I,"ak and gibber in the Roman streets;  
    As stars with trains of fire, "
83,ACT I - Scene I,"and dews of blood,
    Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
    Upon"
84,ACT I - Scene I," whose influence Neptune's empire stands
    Was sick almost to doomsday"
85,ACT I - Scene I," with eclipse.
    And even the like precurse of fierce events,
    As h"
86,ACT I - Scene I,"arbingers preceding still the fates
    And prologue to the omen coming "
87,ACT I - Scene I,"on,
    Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
    Unto our climatu"
88,ACT I - Scene I,"re and countrymen.

                      Enter Ghost again.

    But so"
89,ACT I - Scene I,"ft! behold! Lo, where it comes again!
    I'll cross it, though it blast"
90,ACT I - Scene I," me.- Stay illusion!
                                               Spre"
91,ACT I - Scene I,"ads his arms.
    If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
    Speak to "
92,ACT I - Scene I,"me.
    If there be any good thing to be done,
    That may to thee do e"
93,ACT I - Scene I,"ase, and, race to me,
    Speak to me.  
    If thou art privy to thy co"
94,ACT I - Scene I,"untry's fate,
    Which happily foreknowing may avoid,
    O, speak!
   "
95,ACT I - Scene I," Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
    Extorted treasure in the womb"
96,ACT I - Scene I," of earth
    (For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death),
    "
97,ACT I - Scene I,"                                             The cock crows.
    Speak o"
98,ACT I - Scene I,"f it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!
  Mar. Shall I strike at it "
99,ACT I - Scene I,"with my partisan?
  Hor. Do, if it will not stand.
  Ber. 'Tis here!
  H"
100,ACT I - Scene I,"or. 'Tis here!
  Mar. 'Tis gone!
                                       "
101,ACT I - Scene I,"              Exit Ghost.
    We do it wrong, being so majestical,
    T"
102,ACT I - Scene I,"o offer it the show of violence;
    For it is as the air, invulnerable,"
103,ACT I - Scene I,"
    And our vain blows malicious mockery.
  Ber. It was about to speak,"
104,ACT I - Scene I," when the cock crew.
  Hor. And then it started, like a guilty thing  
 "
105,ACT I - Scene I,"   Upon a fearful summons. I have heard
    The cock, that is the trumpe"
106,ACT I - Scene I,"t to the morn,
    Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
    Aw"
107,ACT I - Scene I,"ake the god of day; and at his warning,
    Whether in sea or fire, in e"
108,ACT I - Scene I,"arth or air,
    Th' extravagant and erring spirit hies
    To his confi"
109,ACT I - Scene I,"ne; and of the truth herein
    This present object made probation.
  Ma"
110,ACT I - Scene I,"r. It faded on the crowing of the cock.
    Some say that ever, 'gainst "
111,ACT I - Scene I,"that season comes
    Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
    The"
112,ACT I - Scene I," bird of dawning singeth all night long;
    And then, they say, no spir"
113,ACT I - Scene I,"it dare stir abroad,
    The nights are wholesome, then no planets strik"
114,ACT I - Scene I,"e,
    No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
    So hallow'd an"
115,ACT I - Scene I,"d so gracious is the time.
  Hor. So have I heard and do in part believe"
116,ACT I - Scene I," it.
    But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
    Walks o'er the d"
117,ACT I - Scene I,"ew of yon high eastward hill.
    Break we our watch up; and by my advic"
118,ACT I - Scene I,"e  
    Let us impart what we have seen to-night
    Unto young Hamlet; "
119,ACT I - Scene I,"for, upon my life,
    This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
    D"
120,ACT I - Scene I,"o you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
    As needful in our loves"
121,ACT I - Scene I,", fitting our duty?
    Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know

Elsinore. A room of state in the Castle.

Flourish. [Enter Claudius, "
124,ACT I - Scene II,"King of Denmark, Gertrude the Queen, Hamlet,
Polonius, Laertes and his s"

Lords Attendant.

  King. Though "
126,ACT I - Scene II,"yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
    The memory be green, and that"
127,ACT I - Scene II," it us befitted
    To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom
 "
128,ACT I - Scene II,"   To be contracted in one brow of woe,
    Yet so far hath discretion f"
129,ACT I - Scene II,"ought with nature
    That we with wisest sorrow think on him
    Togeth"
130,ACT I - Scene II,"er with remembrance of ourselves.
    Therefore our sometime sister, now"
131,ACT I - Scene II," our queen,
    Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state,
    Have w"
132,ACT I - Scene II,"e, as 'twere with a defeated joy,
    With an auspicious, and a dropping"
133,ACT I - Scene II," eye,
    With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,
    In equa"
134,ACT I - Scene II,"l scale weighing delight and dole,
    Taken to wife; nor have we herein"
135,ACT I - Scene II," barr'd
    Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone  
    With this "
136,ACT I - Scene II,"affair along. For all, our thanks.
    Now follows, that you know, young"
137,ACT I - Scene II," Fortinbras,
    Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
    Or thinking b"
138,ACT I - Scene II,"y our late dear brother's death
    Our state to be disjoint and out of "
139,ACT I - Scene II,"frame,
    Colleagued with this dream of his advantage,
    He hath not "
140,ACT I - Scene II,"fail'd to pester us with message
    Importing the surrender of those la"
141,ACT I - Scene II,"nds
    Lost by his father, with all bands of law,
    To our most valia"
142,ACT I - Scene II,"nt brother. So much for him.
    Now for ourself and for this time of me"
143,ACT I - Scene II,"eting.
    Thus much the business is: we have here writ
    To Norway, u"
144,ACT I - Scene II,"ncle of young Fortinbras,
    Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears
 "
145,ACT I - Scene II,"   Of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress
    His further gait herein"
146,ACT I - Scene II,", in that the levies,
    The lists, and full proportions are all made
 "
147,ACT I - Scene II,"   Out of his subject; and we here dispatch
    You, good Cornelius, and"
148,ACT I - Scene II," you, Voltemand,
    For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,  
    G"
149,ACT I - Scene II,"iving to you no further personal power
    To business with the King, mo"
150,ACT I - Scene II,"re than the scope
    Of these dilated articles allow.            [Gives"
151,ACT I - Scene II," a paper.]
    Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
  Cor., V"
152,ACT I - Scene II,"olt. In that, and all things, will we show our duty.
  King. We doubt it"
153,ACT I - Scene II," nothing. Heartily farewell.
                                 Exeunt Vol"
154,ACT I - Scene II,"temand and Cornelius.
    And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
  "
155,ACT I - Scene II,"  You told us of some suit. What is't, Laertes?
    You cannot speak of "
156,ACT I - Scene II,"reason to the Dane
    And lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg, Laert"
157,ACT I - Scene II,"es,
    That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
    The head is not "
158,ACT I - Scene II,"more native to the heart,
    The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
 "
159,ACT I - Scene II,"   Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
    What wouldst thou ha"
160,ACT I - Scene II,"ve, Laertes?
  Laer. My dread lord,
    Your leave and favour to return "
161,ACT I - Scene II,"to France;
    From whence though willingly I came to Denmark
    To sho"
162,ACT I - Scene II,"w my duty in your coronation,  
    Yet now I must confess, that duty do"
163,ACT I - Scene II,"ne,
    My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
    And bow them"
164,ACT I - Scene II," to your gracious leave and pardon.
  King. Have you your father's leave"
165,ACT I - Scene II,"? What says Polonius?
  Pol. He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow lea"
166,ACT I - Scene II,"ve
    By laboursome petition, and at last
    Upon his will I seal'd my"
167,ACT I - Scene II," hard consent.
    I do beseech you give him leave to go.
  King. Take t"
168,ACT I - Scene II,"hy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine,
    And thy best graces spend it a"
169,ACT I - Scene II,"t thy will!
    But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son-
  Ham. [aside] A "
170,ACT I - Scene II,"little more than kin, and less than kind!
  King. How is it that the clo"

  Ham. Not so, my lord. I am too much i' th' sun."
172,ACT I - Scene II,"
  Queen. Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
    And let thine ey"
173,ACT I - Scene II,"e look like a friend on Denmark.
    Do not for ever with thy vailed lid"
174,ACT I - Scene II,"s
    Seek for thy noble father in the dust.
    Thou know'st 'tis commo"

  "
176,ACT I - Scene II,"Ham. Ay, madam, it is common.
  Queen. If it be,

  Ham. Seems, madam, Nay, it is. I know not 'seems.'
"

  King. 'Tis sweet and commendable in "

    To give these mourning duties to your father;
 "

188,ACT I - Scene II,"   To do obsequious sorrow. But to persever

    Of impious stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly grief;

   Will Y"

  Ham. Into my grave?
  Pol. Indeed, th"
814,ACT II - Scene II,"at is out o' th' air. [Aside] How pregnant sometimes
    his replies are"
815,ACT II - Scene II,"! a happiness that often madness hits on, which
    reason and sanity co"
816,ACT II - Scene II,"uld not so prosperously be delivered of. I
    will leave him and sudden"

    him and my daughter.- My ho"
818,ACT II - Scene II,"nourable lord, I will most humbly take
    my leave of you.
  Ham. You c"

    willingly part wi"

821,ACT II - Scene II,"       Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

  Pol. Fare you well, my lor"
822,ACT II - Scene II,"d.
  Ham. These tedious old fools!
  Pol. You go to seek the Lord Hamlet"
823,ACT II - Scene II,". There he is.
  Ros. [to Polonius] God save you, sir!
                 "
824,ACT II - Scene II,"                               Exit [Polonius].  
  Guil. My honour'd lo"
825,ACT II - Scene II,"rd!
  Ros. My most dear lord!
  Ham. My excellent good friends! How dost"
826,ACT II - Scene II," thou, Guildenstern? Ah,
    Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?
  R"
827,ACT II - Scene II,"os. As the indifferent children of the earth.
  Guil. Happy in that we a"
828,ACT II - Scene II,"re not over-happy.
    On Fortune's cap we are not the very button.
  Ha"
829,ACT II - Scene II,"m. Nor the soles of her shoe?
  Ros. Neither, my lord.
  Ham. Then you l"
830,ACT II - Scene II,"ive about her waist, or in the middle of her
    favours?
  Guil. Faith,"
831,ACT II - Scene II," her privates we.
  Ham. In the secret parts of Fortune? O! most true! s"
832,ACT II - Scene II,"he is a
    strumpet. What news ?
  Ros. None, my lord, but that the wor"
833,ACT II - Scene II,"ld's grown honest.
  Ham. Then is doomsday near! But your news is not tr"
834,ACT II - Scene II,"ue. Let me
    question more in particular. What have you, my good frien"
835,ACT II - Scene II,"ds,
    deserved at the hands of Fortune that she sends you to prison
  "
836,ACT II - Scene II,"  hither?
  Guil. Prison, my lord?  
  Ham. Denmark's a prison.
  Ros. T"
837,ACT II - Scene II,"hen is the world one.
  Ham. A goodly one; in which there are many confi"
838,ACT II - Scene II,"nes, wards, and
    dungeons, Denmark being one o' th' worst.
  Ros. We "
839,ACT II - Scene II,"think not so, my lord.
  Ham. Why, then 'tis none to you; for there is n"
840,ACT II - Scene II,"othing either good
    or bad but thinking makes it so. To me it is a pr"
841,ACT II - Scene II,"ison.
  Ros. Why, then your ambition makes it one. 'Tis too narrow for y"
842,ACT II - Scene II,"our
    mind.
  Ham. O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and count m"
843,ACT II - Scene II,"yself a
    king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.
"
844,ACT II - Scene II,"  Guil. Which dreams indeed are ambition; for the very substance of
    "
845,ACT II - Scene II,"the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.
  Ham. A dream itself is "
846,ACT II - Scene II,"but a shadow.
  Ros. Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a q"
847,ACT II - Scene II,"uality that
    it is but a shadow's shadow.
  Ham. Then are our beggars"
848,ACT II - Scene II," bodies, and our monarchs and outstretch'd
    heroes the beggars' shado"
849,ACT II - Scene II,"ws. Shall we to th' court? for, by my
    fay, I cannot reason.
  Both. "
850,ACT II - Scene II,"We'll wait upon you.  
  Ham. No such matter! I will not sort you with t"
851,ACT II - Scene II,"he rest of my
    servants; for, to speak to you like an honest man, I a"
852,ACT II - Scene II,"m most
    dreadfully attended. But in the beaten way of friendship, wha"
853,ACT II - Scene II,"t
    make you at Elsinore?
  Ros. To visit you, my lord; no other occas"
854,ACT II - Scene II,"ion.
  Ham. Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you;"
855,ACT II - Scene II,"
    and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny. Were
  "
856,ACT II - Scene II,"  you not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free
    visitatio"
857,ACT II - Scene II,"n? Come, deal justly with me. Come, come! Nay, speak.
  Guil. What shoul"
858,ACT II - Scene II,"d we say, my lord?
  Ham. Why, anything- but to th' purpose. You were se"
859,ACT II - Scene II,"nt for; and
    there is a kind of confession in your looks, which your "
860,ACT II - Scene II,"modesties
    have not craft enough to colour. I know the good King and "
861,ACT II - Scene II,"Queen
    have sent for you.
  Ros. To what end, my lord?
  Ham. That yo"
862,ACT II - Scene II,"u must teach me. But let me conjure you by the rights
    of our fellows"
863,ACT II - Scene II,"hip, by the consonancy of our youth, by the
    obligation of our ever-p"
864,ACT II - Scene II,"reserved love, and by what more dear a
    better proposer could charge "
865,ACT II - Scene II,"you withal, be even and direct with
    me, whether you were sent for or"
866,ACT II - Scene II," no.  
  Ros. [aside to Guildenstern] What say you?
  Ham. [aside] Nay t"
867,ACT II - Scene II,"hen, I have an eye of you.- If you love me, hold
    not off.
  Guil. My"
868,ACT II - Scene II," lord, we were sent for.
  Ham. I will tell you why. So shall my anticip"
869,ACT II - Scene II,"ation prevent your
    discovery, and your secrecy to the King and Queen"
870,ACT II - Scene II," moult no
    feather. I have of late- but wherefore I know not- lost al"
871,ACT II - Scene II,"l my
    mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed, it goes so
"
872,ACT II - Scene II,"    heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the earth,
    s"
873,ACT II - Scene II,"eems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy, the
    air"
874,ACT II - Scene II,", look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this majestical
    roof f"
875,ACT II - Scene II,"retted with golden fire- why, it appeareth no other thing
    to me than"
876,ACT II - Scene II," a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What a
    piece of work "
877,ACT II - Scene II,"is a man! how noble in reason! how infinite in
    faculties! in form an"
878,ACT II - Scene II,"d moving how express and admirable! in
    action how like an angel! in "
879,ACT II - Scene II,"apprehension how like a god! the
    beauty of the world, the paragon of"
880,ACT II - Scene II," animals! And yet to me what
    is this quintessence of dust? Man delig"
881,ACT II - Scene II,"hts not me- no, nor woman
    neither, though by your smiling you seem t"
882,ACT II - Scene II,"o say so.
  Ros. My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.  
  Ha"
883,ACT II - Scene II,"m. Why did you laugh then, when I said 'Man delights not me'?
  Ros. To "
884,ACT II - Scene II,"think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten
    entertainment"
885,ACT II - Scene II," the players shall receive from you. We coted them
    on the way, and h"
886,ACT II - Scene II,"ither are they coming to offer you service.
  Ham. He that plays the kin"
887,ACT II - Scene II,"g shall be welcome- his Majesty shall
    have tribute of me; the advent"
888,ACT II - Scene II,"urous knight shall use his foil and
    target; the lover shall not sigh"
889,ACT II - Scene II," gratis; the humorous man shall
    end his part in peace; the clown sha"
890,ACT II - Scene II,"ll make those laugh whose
    lungs are tickle o' th' sere; and the lady"
891,ACT II - Scene II," shall say her mind
    freely, or the blank verse shall halt fort. What"
892,ACT II - Scene II," players are
    they?
  Ros. Even those you were wont to take such deli"
893,ACT II - Scene II,"ght in, the
    tragedians of the city.
  Ham. How chances it they trave"
894,ACT II - Scene II,"l? Their residence, both in
    reputation and profit, was better both w"
895,ACT II - Scene II,"ays.
  Ros. I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late
    "
896,ACT II - Scene II,"innovation.
  Ham. Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was "
897,ACT II - Scene II,"in the
    city? Are they so follow'd?
  Ros. No indeed are they not.  
"
898,ACT II - Scene II,"  Ham. How comes it? Do they grow rusty?
  Ros. Nay, their endeavour kee"
899,ACT II - Scene II,"ps in the wonted pace; but there is,
    sir, an eyrie of children, litt"
900,ACT II - Scene II,"le eyases, that cry out on the top
    of question and are most tyrannic"
901,ACT II - Scene II,"ally clapp'd fort. These are now
    the fashion, and so berattle the co"
902,ACT II - Scene II,"mmon stages (so they call
    them) that many wearing rapiers are afraid"
903,ACT II - Scene II," of goosequills and
    dare scarce come thither.
  Ham. What, are they "
904,ACT II - Scene II,"children? Who maintains 'em? How are they
    escoted? Will they pursue "
905,ACT II - Scene II,"the quality no longer than they can
    sing? Will they not say afterwar"
906,ACT II - Scene II,"ds, if they should grow
    themselves to common players (as it is most "
907,ACT II - Scene II,"like, if their means
    are no better), their writers do them wrong to "
908,ACT II - Scene II,"make them exclaim
    against their own succession.
  Ros. Faith, there "
909,ACT II - Scene II,"has been much to do on both sides; and the nation
    holds it no sin to"
910,ACT II - Scene II," tarre them to controversy. There was, for a
    while, no money bid for"
911,ACT II - Scene II," argument unless the poet and the player
    went to cuffs in the questi"
912,ACT II - Scene II,"on.
  Ham. Is't possible?
  Guil. O, there has been much throwing about "
913,ACT II - Scene II,"of brains.
  Ham. Do the boys carry it away?  
  Ros. Ay, that they do, "
914,ACT II - Scene II,"my lord- Hercules and his load too.
  Ham. It is not very strange; for m"
915,ACT II - Scene II,"y uncle is King of Denmark, and
    those that would make mows at him wh"
916,ACT II - Scene II,"ile my father lived give
    twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats apie"
917,ACT II - Scene II,"ce for his picture in

    philosophy could find it out.

  Guil. There are the players.
  Ham. Gen"
920,ACT II - Scene II,"tlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come! Th'
    appurtena"
921,ACT II - Scene II,"nce of welcome is fashion and ceremony. Let me comply
    with you in th"
922,ACT II - Scene II,"is garb, lest my extent to the players (which I
    tell you must show f"
923,ACT II - Scene II,"airly outwards) should more appear like
    entertainment than yours. Yo"
924,ACT II - Scene II,"u are welcome. But my uncle-father
    and aunt-mother are deceiv'd.
  G"
925,ACT II - Scene II,"uil. In what, my dear lord?
  Ham. I am but mad north-north-west. When t"

    know a hawk from a handsaw.

  Pol. Well be with you, gentlemen!
  Ham"

  Ros"
930,ACT II - Scene II,". Happily he's the second time come to them; for they say an old

931,ACT II - Scene II," is twice a child.
  Ham. I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the pla"
932,ACT II - Scene II,"yers. Mark it.-
   You say right, sir; a Monday morning; twas so indeed."
933,ACT II - Scene II,"
  Pol. My lord, I have news to tell you.
  Ham. My lord, I have news to"
934,ACT II - Scene II," tell you. When Roscius was an actor in
    Rome-
  Pol. The actors are "
935,ACT II - Scene II,"come hither, my lord.
  Ham. Buzz, buzz!
  Pol. Upon my honour-
  Ham. T"

  Pol. The best actors in the world, eit"
937,ACT II - Scene II,"her for tragedy, comedy,

938,ACT II - Scene II,"ical-pastoral,
    tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-past"
939,ACT II - Scene II,"oral; scene  
    individable, or poem unlimited. Seneca cannot be too h"
940,ACT II - Scene II,"eavy, nor
    Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty, th"
941,ACT II - Scene II,"ese are
    the only men.
  Ham. O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a tre"
942,ACT II - Scene II,"asure hadst thou!
  Pol. What treasure had he, my lord?
  Ham. Why,

   "
943,ACT II - Scene II,"      'One fair daughter, and no more,
           The which he loved pas"
944,ACT II - Scene II,"sing well.'

  Pol. [aside] Still on my daughter.
  Ham. Am I not i' th'"
945,ACT II - Scene II," right, old Jephthah?
  Pol. If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a "
946,ACT II - Scene II,"daughter that I
    love passing well.
  Ham. Nay, that follows not.
  P"
947,ACT II - Scene II,"ol. What follows then, my lord?
  Ham. Why,

           'As by lot, God "
948,ACT II - Scene II,"wot,'

 and then, you know,
  
           'It came to pass, as most like"
949,ACT II - Scene II," it was.'

    The first row of the pious chanson will show you more; fo"
950,ACT II - Scene II,"r look
    where my abridgment comes.

                     Enter four o"
951,ACT II - Scene II,"r five Players.

    You are welcome, masters; welcome, all.- I am glad "
952,ACT II - Scene II,"to see thee
    well.- Welcome, good friends.- O, my old friend? Why, th"

955,ACT II - Scene II,"adyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last by the
    altitude"
956,ACT II - Scene II," of a chopine. Pray God your voice, like a piece of

957,ACT II - Scene II,"be not crack'd within the ring.- Masters, you are
    all welcome. We'll"
958,ACT II - Scene II," e'en to't like French falconers, fly at

959,ACT II - Scene II," a speech straight. Come, give us a
    taste of your quality. Come, a p"
960,ACT II - Scene II,"assionate speech.
  1. Play. What speech, my good lord?
  Ham. I heard t"
961,ACT II - Scene II,"hee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted;
    or if it was, no"
962,ACT II - Scene II,"t above once; for the play, I remember, pleas'd  
    not the million, '"
963,ACT II - Scene II,"twas caviary to the general; but it was (as I
    receiv'd it, and other"
964,ACT II - Scene II,"s, whose judgments in such matters cried in
    the top of mine) an exce"
965,ACT II - Scene II,"llent play, well digested in the scenes,
    set down with as much modes"
966,ACT II - Scene II,"ty as cunning. I remember one said
    there were no sallets in the line"
967,ACT II - Scene II,"s to make the matter savoury,
    nor no matter in the phrase that might"
968,ACT II - Scene II," indict the author of
    affectation; but call'd it an honest method, a"
969,ACT II - Scene II,"s wholesome as
    sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One "
970,ACT II - Scene II,"speech in't
    I chiefly lov'd. 'Twas AEneas' tale to Dido, and thereab"

  Ham.   Aha! Come, some music! Come, the recorders"

         For if the King like not the comedy,
         Why then, belik"

    Come, some music!

                Enter R"

  Guil. Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word "
1421,ACT III - Scene II,"with you.
  Ham. Sir, a whole history.
  Guil. The King, sir-
  Ham. Ay,"
1422,ACT III - Scene II," sir, what of him?
  Guil. Is in his retirement, marvellous distemper'd."
1423,ACT III - Scene II,"  
  Ham. With drink, sir?
  Guil. No, my lord; rather with choler.
  Ha"
1424,ACT III - Scene II,"m. Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to
    the"
1425,ACT III - Scene II," doctor; for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps
    plunge him"
1426,ACT III - Scene II," into far more choler.
  Guil. Good my lord, put your discourse into som"
1427,ACT III - Scene II,"e frame, and start
    not so wildly from my affair.
  Ham. I am tame, s"
1428,ACT III - Scene II,"ir; pronounce.
  Guil. The Queen, your mother, in most great affliction "
1429,ACT III - Scene II,"of spirit
    hath sent me to you.
  Ham. You are welcome.
  Guil. Nay, "
1430,ACT III - Scene II,"good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right breed.
    If it shall p"
1431,ACT III - Scene II,"lease you to make me a wholesome answer, I will do
    your mother's com"
1432,ACT III - Scene II,"mandment; if not, your pardon and my return
    shall be the end of my b"
1433,ACT III - Scene II,"usiness.
  Ham. Sir, I cannot.
  Guil. What, my lord?
  Ham. Make you a "
1434,ACT III - Scene II,"wholesome answer; my wit's diseas'd. But, sir, such
    answer is I can "
1435,ACT III - Scene II,"make, you shall command; or rather, as you say,
    my mother. Therefore"
1436,ACT III - Scene II," no more, but to the matter! My mother, you  
    say-
  Ros. Then thus "
1437,ACT III - Scene II,"she says: your behaviour hath struck her into
    amazement and admirati"
1438,ACT III - Scene II,"on.
  Ham. O wonderful son, that can so stonish a mother! But is there n"
1439,ACT III - Scene II,"o
    sequel at the heels of this mother's admiration? Impart.
  Ros. Sh"
1440,ACT III - Scene II,"e desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to bed.
  Ham. We s"
1441,ACT III - Scene II,"hall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you any
    further trade"
1442,ACT III - Scene II," with us?
  Ros. My lord, you once did love me.
  Ham. And do still, by "
1443,ACT III - Scene II,"these pickers and stealers!
  Ros. Good my lord, what is your cause of d"
1444,ACT III - Scene II,"istemper? You do surely
    bar the door upon your own liberty, if you d"
1445,ACT III - Scene II,"eny your griefs to
    your friend.
  Ham. Sir, I lack advancement.
  Ro"
1446,ACT III - Scene II,"s. How can that be, when you have the voice of the King himself
    for "
1447,ACT III - Scene II,"your succession in Denmark?
  Ham. Ay, sir, but 'while the grass grows'-"
1448,ACT III - Scene II," the proverb is something
    musty.

                     Enter the Pla"
1449,ACT III - Scene II,"yers with recorders.  

    O, the recorders! Let me see one. To withdra"

    you go about to recover the wind of me, as if you"
1451,ACT III - Scene II," would drive me
    into a toil?
  Guil. O my lord, if my duty be too bo"
1452,ACT III - Scene II,"ld, my love is too unmannerly.
  Ham. I do not well understand that. Wil"
1453,ACT III - Scene II,"l you play upon this pipe?
  Guil. My lord, I cannot.
  Ham. I pray you."
1454,ACT III - Scene II,"
  Guil. Believe me, I cannot.
  Ham. I do beseech you.
  Guil. I know, "
1455,ACT III - Scene II,"no touch of it, my lord.
  Ham. It is as easy as lying. Govern these ven"
1456,ACT III - Scene II,"tages with your
    fingers and thumbs, give it breath with your mouth, "
1457,ACT III - Scene II,"and it will
    discourse most eloquent music. Look you, these are the s"
1458,ACT III - Scene II,"tops.
  Guil. But these cannot I command to any utt'rance of harmony. I
"
1459,ACT III - Scene II,"    have not the skill.
  Ham. Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing y"
1460,ACT III - Scene II,"ou make of me! You
    would play upon me; you would seem to know my sto"
1461,ACT III - Scene II,"ps; you would
    pluck out the heart of my mystery; you would sound me "

  Ham. Methinks it is l"

  Pol. It is back'd like a weasel.
  Ham. Or like a whale."
1471,ACT III - Scene II,"
  Pol. Very like a whale.
  Ham. Then will I come to my mother by-and-b"

2387,ACT V - Scene II,"t possible?
  Ham. Here's the commission; read it at more leisure.
    B"
2388,ACT V - Scene II,"ut wilt thou bear me how I did proceed?
  Hor. I beseech you.
  Ham. Bei"
2389,ACT V - Scene II,"ng thus benetted round with villanies,
    Or I could make a prologue to"
2390,ACT V - Scene II," my brains,
    They had begun the play. I sat me down;
    Devis'd a ne"
2391,ACT V - Scene II,"w commission; wrote it fair.
    I once did hold it, as our statists do,"
2392,ACT V - Scene II,"
    A baseness to write fair, and labour'd much
    How to forget that "
2393,ACT V - Scene II,"learning; but, sir, now  
    It did me yeoman's service. Wilt thou know"
2394,ACT V - Scene II,"
    Th' effect of what I wrote?
  Hor. Ay, good my lord.
  Ham. An earn"
2395,ACT V - Scene II,"est conjuration from the King,
    As England was his faithful tributary"
2396,ACT V - Scene II,",
    As love between them like the palm might flourish,
    As peace sh"
2397,ACT V - Scene II,"ould still her wheaten garland wear
    And stand a comma 'tween their a"
2398,ACT V - Scene II,"mities,
    And many such-like as's of great charge,
    That, on the vi"
2399,ACT V - Scene II,"ew and knowing of these contents,
    Without debatement further, more o"
2400,ACT V - Scene II,"r less,
    He should the bearers put to sudden death,
    Not shriving "
2401,ACT V - Scene II,"time allow'd.
  Hor. How was this seal'd?
  Ham. Why, even in that was h"
2402,ACT V - Scene II,"eaven ordinant.
    I had my father's signet in my purse,
    which was "
2403,ACT V - Scene II,"the model of that Danish seal;
    Folded the writ up in the form of th'"
2404,ACT V - Scene II," other,
    Subscrib'd it, gave't th' impression, plac'd it safely,
    "
2405,ACT V - Scene II,"The changeling never known. Now, the next day  
    Was our sea-fight; a"
2406,ACT V - Scene II,"nd what to this was sequent
    Thou know'st already.
  Hor. So Guildens"
2407,ACT V - Scene II,"tern and Rosencrantz go to't.
  Ham. Why, man, they did make love to thi"
2408,ACT V - Scene II,"s employment!
    They are not near my conscience; their defeat
    Does"
2409,ACT V - Scene II," by their own insinuation grow.
    'Tis dangerous when the baser nature"
2410,ACT V - Scene II," comes
    Between the pass and fell incensed points
    Of mighty oppos"
2411,ACT V - Scene II,"ites.
  Hor. Why, what a king is this!
  Ham. Does it not, thinks't thee"
2412,ACT V - Scene II,", stand me now upon-
    He that hath kill'd my king, and whor'd my moth"
2413,ACT V - Scene II,"er;
    Popp'd in between th' election and my hopes;
    Thrown out his "
2414,ACT V - Scene II,"angle for my Proper life,
    And with such coz'nage- is't not perfect c"
2415,ACT V - Scene II,"onscience
    To quit him with this arm? And is't not to be damn'd
    T"
2416,ACT V - Scene II,"o let this canker of our nature come
    In further evil?
  Hor. It must"
2417,ACT V - Scene II," be shortly known to him from England
    What is the issue of the busin"
2418,ACT V - Scene II,"ess there.  
  Ham. It will be short; the interim is mine,
    And a man"
2419,ACT V - Scene II,"'s life is no more than to say 'one.'
    But I am very sorry, good Hora"
2420,ACT V - Scene II,"tio,
    That to Laertes I forgot myself,
    For by the image of my cau"
2421,ACT V - Scene II,"se I see
    The portraiture of his. I'll court his favours.
    But sur"
2422,ACT V - Scene II,"e the bravery of his grief did put me
    Into a tow'ring passion.
  Hor"
2423,ACT V - Scene II,". Peace! Who comes here?

                 Enter young Osric, a courtier"
2424,ACT V - Scene II,".

  Osr. Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.
  Ham. I humbl"
2425,ACT V - Scene II,"y thank you, sir. [Aside to Horatio] Dost know this
    waterfly?
  Hor."
2426,ACT V - Scene II," [aside to Hamlet] No, my good lord.
  Ham. [aside to Horatio] Thy state"
2427,ACT V - Scene II," is the more gracious; for 'tis a
    vice to know him. He hath much lan"
2428,ACT V - Scene II,"d, and fertile. Let a beast be
    lord of beasts, and his crib shall st"
2429,ACT V - Scene II,"and at the king's mess. 'Tis
    a chough; but, as I say, spacious in th"
2430,ACT V - Scene II,"e possession of dirt.  
  Osr. Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leis"
2431,ACT V - Scene II,"ure, I should impart
    a thing to you from his Majesty.
  Ham. I will "
2432,ACT V - Scene II,"receive it, sir, with all diligence of spirit. Put your
    bonnet to hi"
2433,ACT V - Scene II,"s right use. 'Tis for the head.
  Osr. I thank your lordship, it is very"
2434,ACT V - Scene II," hot.
  Ham. No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is northerly.
  Os"
2435,ACT V - Scene II,"r. It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
  Ham. But yet methinks it i"
2436,ACT V - Scene II,"s very sultry and hot for my complexion.
  Osr. Exceedingly, my lord; it"
2437,ACT V - Scene II," is very sultry, as 'twere- I cannot
    tell how. But, my lord, his Maj"
2438,ACT V - Scene II,"esty bade me signify to you that
    he has laid a great wager on your h"
2439,ACT V - Scene II,"ead. Sir, this is the matter-
  Ham. I beseech you remember.
           "
2440,ACT V - Scene II,"                [Hamlet moves him to put on his hat.]
  Osr. Nay, good m"
2441,ACT V - Scene II,"y lord; for mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here is
    newly come to cou"
2442,ACT V - Scene II,"rt Laertes; believe me, an absolute gentleman,
    full of most excellen"
2443,ACT V - Scene II,"t differences, of very soft society and
    great showing. Indeed, to sp"
2444,ACT V - Scene II,"eak feelingly of him, he is the card
    or calendar of gentry; for you "
2445,ACT V - Scene II,"shall find in him the continent of
    what part a gentleman would see.
"
2446,ACT V - Scene II,"  Ham. Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you; though, I  
    "
2447,ACT V - Scene II,"know, to divide him inventorially would dozy th' arithmetic of
    memor"
2448,ACT V - Scene II,"y, and yet but yaw neither in respect of his quick sail.
    But, in the"
2449,ACT V - Scene II," verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of great
    article, and "
2450,ACT V - Scene II,"his infusion of such dearth and rareness as, to make
    true diction of"
2451,ACT V - Scene II," him, his semblable is his mirror, and who else
    would trace him, his"
2452,ACT V - Scene II," umbrage, nothing more.
  Osr. Your lordship speaks most infallibly of h"
2453,ACT V - Scene II,"im.
  Ham. The concernancy, sir? Why do we wrap the gentleman in our mor"
2454,ACT V - Scene II,"e
    rawer breath
  Osr. Sir?
  Hor [aside to Hamlet] Is't not possible"
2455,ACT V - Scene II," to understand in another
    tongue? You will do't, sir, really.
  Ham."
2456,ACT V - Scene II," What imports the nomination of this gentleman
  Osr. Of Laertes?
  Hor."
2457,ACT V - Scene II," [aside] His purse is empty already. All's golden words are
    spent.
 "
2458,ACT V - Scene II," Ham. Of him, sir.
  Osr. I know you are not ignorant-
  Ham. I would yo"
2459,ACT V - Scene II,"u did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it would not
    much approve me."
2460,ACT V - Scene II," Well, sir?  
  Osr. You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is-"
2461,ACT V - Scene II,"
  Ham. I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in
    e"
2462,ACT V - Scene II,"xcellence; but to know a man well were to know himself.
  Osr. I mean, s"
2463,ACT V - Scene II,"ir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on him
    by them, in hi"
2464,ACT V - Scene II,"s meed he's unfellowed.
  Ham. What's his weapon?
  Osr. Rapier and dagg"
2465,ACT V - Scene II,"er.
  Ham. That's two of his weapons- but well.
  Osr. The King, sir, ha"
2466,ACT V - Scene II,"th wager'd with him six Barbary horses;
    against the which he has imp"
2467,ACT V - Scene II,"on'd, as I take it, six French
    rapiers and poniards, with their assi"
2468,ACT V - Scene II,"gns, as girdle, hangers, and
    so. Three of the carriages, in faith, a"
2469,ACT V - Scene II,"re very dear to fancy,
    very responsive to the hilts, most delicate c"
2470,ACT V - Scene II,"arriages, and of
    very liberal conceit.
  Ham. What call you the carr"
2471,ACT V - Scene II,"iages?
  Hor. [aside to Hamlet] I knew you must be edified by the margen"
2472,ACT V - Scene II,"t
    ere you had done.
  Osr. The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
  Ha"
2473,ACT V - Scene II,"m. The phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could
    carry "
2474,ACT V - Scene II,"cannon by our sides. I would it might be hangers till then.  
    But on"
2475,ACT V - Scene II,"! Six Barbary horses against six French swords, their
    assigns, and t"
2476,ACT V - Scene II,"hree liberal-conceited carriages: that's the French
    bet against the "
2477,ACT V - Scene II,"Danish. Why is this all impon'd, as you call it?
  Osr. The King, sir, h"
2478,ACT V - Scene II,"ath laid that, in a dozen passes between
    yourself and him, he shall "
2479,ACT V - Scene II,"not exceed you three hits; he hath
    laid on twelve for nine, and it w"
2480,ACT V - Scene II,"ould come to immediate trial
    if your lordship would vouchsafe the an"
2481,ACT V - Scene II,"swer.
  Ham. How if I answer no?
  Osr. I mean, my lord, the opposition "
2482,ACT V - Scene II,"of your person in trial.
  Ham. Sir, I will walk here in the hall. If it"
2483,ACT V - Scene II," please his Majesty,
    it is the breathing time of day with me. Let th"
2484,ACT V - Scene II,"e foils be
    brought, the gentleman willing, and the King hold his pur"
2485,ACT V - Scene II,"pose,
    I will win for him if I can; if not, I will gain nothing but m"
2486,ACT V - Scene II,"y
    shame and the odd hits.
  Osr. Shall I redeliver you e'en so?
  Ha"
2487,ACT V - Scene II,"m. To this effect, sir, after what flourish your nature will.
  Osr. I c"
2488,ACT V - Scene II,"ommend my duty to your lordship.
  Ham. Yours, yours. [Exit Osric.] He d"
2489,ACT V - Scene II,"oes well to commend it
    himself; there are no tongues else for's turn"
2490,ACT V - Scene II,".
  Hor. This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.  
  Ham. He "
2491,ACT V - Scene II,"did comply with his dug before he suck'd it. Thus has he,
    and many m"
2492,ACT V - Scene II,"ore of the same bevy that I know the drossy age dotes
    on, only got t"
2493,ACT V - Scene II,"he tune of the time and outward habit of encounter-
    a kind of yesty "
2494,ACT V - Scene II,"collection, which carries them through and
    through the most fann'd a"
2495,ACT V - Scene II,"nd winnowed opinions; and do but blow
    them to their trial-the bubble"
2496,ACT V - Scene II,"s are out,

                            Enter a Lord.

  Lord. My lord, "
2497,ACT V - Scene II,"his Majesty commended him to you by young Osric, who
    brings back to "
2498,ACT V - Scene II,"him, that you attend him in the hall. He sends to
    know if your pleas"
2499,ACT V - Scene II,"ure hold to play with Laertes, or that you will
    take longer time.
  "
2500,ACT V - Scene II,"Ham. I am constant to my purposes; they follow the King's pleasure.
    "
2501,ACT V - Scene II,"If his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now or whensoever, provided
    I "
2502,ACT V - Scene II,"be so able as now.
  Lord. The King and Queen and all are coming down.
 "
2503,ACT V - Scene II," Ham. In happy time.
  Lord. The Queen desires you to use some gentle en"
2504,ACT V - Scene II,"tertainment to
    Laertes before you fall to play.  
  Ham. She well in"
2505,ACT V - Scene II,"structs me.
                                                    [Exit Lo"
2506,ACT V - Scene II,"rd.]
  Hor. You will lose this wager, my lord.
  Ham. I do not think so."
2507,ACT V - Scene II," Since he went into France I have been in
    continual practice. I shal"
2508,ACT V - Scene II,"l win at the odds. But thou wouldst not
    think how ill all's here abo"
2509,ACT V - Scene II,"ut my heart. But it is no matter.
  Hor. Nay, good my lord -
  Ham. It i"
2510,ACT V - Scene II,"s but foolery; but it is such a kind of gaingiving as
    would perhaps "
2511,ACT V - Scene II,"trouble a woman.
  Hor. If your mind dislike anything, obey it. I will f"
2512,ACT V - Scene II,"orestall their
    repair hither and say you are not fit.
  Ham. Not a w"
2513,ACT V - Scene II,"hit, we defy augury; there's a special providence in
    the fall of a s"
2514,ACT V - Scene II,"parrow. If it be now, 'tis not to come', if it be
    not to come, it wi"
2515,ACT V - Scene II,"ll be now; if it be not now, yet it will come:
    the readiness is all."
2516,ACT V - Scene II," Since no man knows aught of what he leaves,
    what is't to leave beti"
2517,ACT V - Scene II,"mes? Let be.

    Enter King, Queen, Laertes, Osric, and Lords, with oth"
2518,ACT V - Scene II,"er
              Attendants with foils and gauntlets.
               A t"
2519,ACT V - Scene II,"able and flagons of wine on it.  

  King. Come, Hamlet, come, and take "
2520,ACT V - Scene II,"this hand from me.
                    [The King puts Laertes' hand into"
2521,ACT V - Scene II," Hamlet's.]
  Ham. Give me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong;
    "
2522,ACT V - Scene II,"But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.
    This presence knows,
    And y"
2523,ACT V - Scene II,"ou must needs have heard, how I am punish'd
    With sore distraction. W"
2524,ACT V - Scene II,"hat I have done
    That might your nature, honour, and exception
    Ro"
2525,ACT V - Scene II,"ughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.
    Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laert"
2526,ACT V - Scene II,"es? Never Hamlet.
    If Hamlet from himself be taken away,
    And when"
2527,ACT V - Scene II," he's not himself does wrong Laertes,
    Then Hamlet does it not, Hamle"
2528,ACT V - Scene II,"t denies it.
    Who does it, then? His madness. If't be so,
    Hamlet "
2529,ACT V - Scene II,"is of the faction that is wrong'd;
    His madness is poor Hamlet's enem"
2530,ACT V - Scene II,"y.
    Sir, in this audience,
    Let my disclaiming from a purpos'd evi"
2531,ACT V - Scene II,"l

    That I have sh"

    And hurt my brother.
  Laer. I am satisfi"
2533,ACT V - Scene II,"ed in nature,
    Whose motive in this case should stir me most
    To m"

    I stand aloof, and will no reco"

    I do receive your offer'd love like love,
    And will not wrong "
2538,ACT V - Scene II,"it.
  Ham. I embrace it freely,
    And will this brother's wager frankl"
2539,ACT V - Scene II,"y play.
    Give us the foils. Come on.
  Laer. Come, one for me.
  Ham."
2540,ACT V - Scene II," I'll be your foil, Laertes. In mine ignorance
    Your skill shall, lik"
2541,ACT V - Scene II,"e a star i' th' darkest night,
    Stick fiery off indeed.
  Laer. You m"

  Ham. No, by this bad.  
  King. Give them the foils, youn"

    You know the wager?
  Ham. Very well, my lor"

    Your Grace has laid the odds o' th' weaker side.
  King. I do not"
2545,ACT V - Scene II," fear it, I have seen you both;
    But since he is better'd, we have th"
2546,ACT V - Scene II,"erefore odds.
  Laer. This is too heavy; let me see another.
  Ham. This"
2547,ACT V - Scene II," likes me well. These foils have all a length?
                         "
2548,ACT V - Scene II,"                       Prepare to play.
  Osr. Ay, my good lord.
  King."
2549,ACT V - Scene II," Set me the stoups of wine upon that table.
    If Hamlet give the first"
2550,ACT V - Scene II," or second hit,
    Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
    Let all"
2551,ACT V - Scene II," the battlements their ordnance fire;
    The King shall drink to Hamlet"

    And in the cup an union shall he throw
    Richer "

    In Denmark's crown have worn. "
2554,ACT V - Scene II,"Give me the cups;

  Ham. One.
  Laer. No."
2559,ACT V - Scene II,"
  Ham. Judgment!
  Osr. A hit, a very palpable hit.
  Laer. Well, again"

  King. Stay, give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;

  Laer. A tou"

  Laer. Say yo"
